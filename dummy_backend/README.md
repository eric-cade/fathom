# Fathom Dummy Backend

This is a lightweight local backend for developing and exploring **Fathom** without
API keys, cloud services, or production infrastructure.

It implements the same HTTP endpoints used by the production backend, but runs
entirely on your local machine and stores state in simple JSON files.

---

## What this is for

- Local development
- UI / UX iteration
- Open source contributions
- Testing feed logic (paging, voting, reactions, power)

You **do not** need the production backend to run the frontend.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Git

---

## Setup

From the `dummy_backend/` directory:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate   # Git Bash on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

You should see:
	Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000

Test in a browser (optional):
http://127.0.0.1:8000/health

## Notes

- Per-user state is tracked via the X-User-Id header (generated by the frontend).

- Votes, reactions, and power persist between restarts using local JSON files.

- This backend intentionally avoids external dependencies (databases, APIs).

## Production backend

The production backend lives elsewhere in the repository and is not required
for local development.

Use this dummy backend unless you are working on deployment or backend internals.
